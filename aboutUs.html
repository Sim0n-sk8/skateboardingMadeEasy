<div class = "course"><!--(W3Schools,2024)--><p><h2><u>Our History:</u></h2></p></div>    
<p>I started skateboarding in late 2018 after getting a longboard to skate along with my older brother.</p>
<p>That longboard fortunately snapped in early 2019 and I got my first skateboard and was hooked on learning tricks.</p>
<p>I quickly realized that doing this alone is really difficult as no amount of online videos can provide you with the help you can get in person.</p>
<p>The same year I unfortunately broke my leg and realized that there is a gap in the community. We needed someone to help teach people how to skateboard safely.</p>
<p>The need for a skateboarding coaching service was made very apparent.The community needed someone to teach how to skate safely and make it fun to learn.</p>

<p>This is where the idea for Skateboarding made Easy came to life. </p>
<p>Skateboarding made simple is there for those who need a little push (unirronically). For people who wants to start this amazing sport but are simply to scared to try</p>
<P>Skateboarding made Easy was created to teach people of <abbr title="Port Elizabeth">PE</abbr><!--(The IIE,2024)--> how skateboard safely.</P>

<br>

<div class = "course"><!--(W3Schools,2024)--><p><h2><u>Vision:</u></h2></p></div>
<p>Our vision with Skateboarding made Easy&trade;<!--(The IIE,2024)--> is to grow the skateboarding community in <abbr title="Port Elizabeth">PE</abbr> <!--(The IIE,2024)--></p>
