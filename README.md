# SkateboardingMadeEasy

## CSS / Improvements:

The reason why CSS and my improvements are both in the same header is because i pretty much redid the whole website due to my low mark in part two of this project.
Ill be breaking it down by page:

### All the pages:

I moved the logo into the navigation bar to remove the whitespace.
I centered the footer across all the pages.
I made sure the whole website is responsive
I changed the background color 


### The navigation bar:

Originally the navigation bar was on it own at the top and the logo was beneath it which created whitespace to a degree that it was a eye sore so I move the logo into the navigation bar to the left and styled the buttons so that it changes color and grows when hovering over it. It created this clean look and feeling.

### Home page:

The original idea of the home page was to have a video be the title but i decided on a image paired with a parralax effect (W3Schools,2024) to create a really nice effect
I added the title with a overlay (W3Schools,2024) and played around with the positioning to make it look appealing.
I added a google form(Google Forms,2024) and styled it to match the color scheme of the whole website.
a Big issue was the table. It was a eye sore and i fixed it bye using different styling methods to make it match the website and also look more appealing.

Other than that i didnt change alot of the text formatting of the home page.

### About Us 

I added a "block" around all the important information telling the user more about the company and the added more videos at the bottom of the page to make the page look more alive 
I added a diffrent color to the title as apossed to just being black.
I also just formated some parts of the page to make it look nice but it is all minor things

### Our Work

I broke the page up using section tags(W3Schools,2024) and with that I created the "block" that I used in the about us page aswell.
I then split the sections so that we have a intro, course and gallery section so that i can style them individually 
The block i made a different color to the background color that it just ever so slightly stands out and pairing that with a box-shadow(W3Schools,2024) It just made it pop 
I added styling to the text within the "block" to make the different parts stand out and catch the users attention.
I just added a border-raduis (W3Schools,2024) to all the images on the page.

### Contact Us 

I redid the whole page starting with the form.
I made the form bigger and removed the gradient affect aswell as made the checkbokes / radio buttons be in a row to make it look nicer
I then removed the images around the map a it was a horrible choice to start iwth and made the map bigger to fit the screen, I also added a border around the map.(Google Maps,2024)

All the contact us details was put in the same block that I created in the Our Work page and changed the color of the hyperlinks.


### Gallery 
 the only CSS changes that i added to the gallery was the intro and i did so by removing the border around the image and added a border-raduis (w3Schools,2024) and changed the subheading to a grey color which really brought the page together.


 ## Java/functions


### Footer

I added all the neccesary Java shown in class to the footer an used our WIL group name as the person web hosting this website as i thought that would be a nice crossover between my projects.
The footer displays the Title of te company, the last edited time and then the person hosting the site (The IIE,2024)

### SEO tags 

I added SEO tags to all the images in the gallery and added a lightbox that was provided to us by our lecturer (The IIE,2024)
